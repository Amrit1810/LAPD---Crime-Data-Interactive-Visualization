## Project Goals

This project seeks to achieve the following goals, categorized into two main themes:

**1. Public Safety and Awareness:**
    *   Analyze the trend of different crime types over time.
    *   **Q:** What is the overall crime rate trend? What are the top crimes?
    *   Identify crime hotspots across Los Angeles.
    *   **Q:** What are the most risky neighbourhoods?
    *   Understand victim demographics (vulnerable groups).
    *   **Q:** What is the distribution of victim sex and age range?
    *   Pinpoint high-crime times.
    *   **Q:** Which day of the week and what time of the day are typically less safe for residents?

**2. Police Transparency and Accountability:**
    *   Identify potential biases or areas for scrutiny.
    *   **Q:** Is there any bias regarding the police's claim of reducing crime reporting? (Investigated via reporting delay).
    *   Inform resource allocation by highlighting areas with higher crime rates or specific crime types.
    *   **Q:** What is the most common crime in each neighbourhood?
    *   Make crime data readily available and understandable.
    *   Visualize crime data from the last 4 years (2020-2024) in an interactive manner.

## Analysis and Findings

### Time Analysis

*   **Q: Yearly Trend?**
    *   **A:** The overall crime rate in Los Angeles shows a clear **increasing trend** year-over-year from 2020 to 2024.
*   **Q: Monthly Pattern?**
    *   **A:** Crime rates exhibit monthly seasonality, with **October** consistently showing peak crime levels across the years analyzed.
*   **Q: Weekly Pattern?**
    *   **A:** While crime distribution is relatively even daily, **Friday** consistently shows the highest number of reported crimes.
*   **Q: Daily Pattern (Time of Day)?**
    *   **A:** The **Afternoon** period experiences the highest volume of crime compared to Morning, Evening, and Night.
*   **Synthesis:** It's significant that crime rates are rising, peaking in October, on Fridays, and often occurring in broad daylight (Afternoons). This prompts questions about control measures and the nature of these crimes.

### Crime Analysis (Location, Type, Demographics)

*   **Q: Where are crimes happening (Hotspots)?**
    *   **A:** Geographic visualization (Bubble Map) identifies distinct **crime hotspots** within Los Angeles where crime is more concentrated.
*   **Q: Most affected area during the peak month (October)?**
    *   **A:** Filtering for October reveals the **'Central' area** experiences the highest crime rate during this peak month.
*   **Q: Most affected premises in Central during October?**
    *   **A:** Within the Central area in October, crimes most frequently occur on the **'Street'**, followed by 'Multi-Unit Dwelling' and 'Sidewalk'.
*   **Q: Top 5 Crimes (given street prevalence)?**
    *   **A:** The most common crimes, particularly relevant given the 'Street' premise, are **'Motor Vehicle Theft'** and **'Burglary From Vehicle'**, significantly outpacing other crime types like Simple Assault, Domestic Violence, and Vandalism.
*   **Q: Top 5 Weapons/Means Used?**
    *   **A:** The analysis of weapons/means used indicates that **'Strong-Arm'** (implying physical force without a weapon/bare hands) is the most common, followed by 'Verbal Threat', 'Gun', and 'Knife'.
*   **Synthesis:** A pattern emerges: Increasing crime, often vehicle-related, occurs frequently on streets in areas like Central, particularly during October afternoons/Fridays, and commonly involves physical force or threats rather than firearms as the primary means.

### Supporting Analysis (Demographics & Reporting)

*   **Q: Victim Race Distribution?**
    *   **A:** Bubble chart shows victim distribution by race, with Hispanic/Latin/Mexican, Black, and White appearing as the largest groups. **Caveat:** As noted in the analysis, without corresponding population data for normalization, definitive conclusions about disproportionate victimization or bias cannot be drawn solely from this chart.
*   **Q: Victim Age/Sex Distribution?**
    *   **A:** Histogram shows the highest number of victims fall within the **20-40 age group**. Gender distribution appears relatively balanced across age groups. **Caveat:** Similar to race, this observation requires further context and does not strongly point to specific gender-based targeting on its own.
*   **Q: Delay in Reporting Time?**
    *   **A:** A critical finding is that the average time gap (in days) between a crime occurring and it being reported has been **steadily increasing** from 2020 to 2024. This is counter-intuitive and raises significant questions.
    *   **Key Question Raised:** Why is reporting time increasing? Does this reflect a lack of public faith in LAPD, procedural changes, or other factors?

---

## Summary of Findings

*   **Time:** Crime is demonstrably increasing yearly (2020-2024), peaks in October, slightly higher on Fridays, and most common during Afternoons.
*   **Crime:** The 'Central' area is a key hotspot, especially in October. Crimes frequently occur on 'Streets', with 'Motor Vehicle Theft' and 'Burglary from Vehicle' being dominant types. 'Strong-Arm' tactics and 'Verbal Threats' are common means.
*   **Supporting Insights & Caveats:**
    *   While victim demographics (Race: Hispanic/Latin/Mexican, Black, White; Age: 20-40) show concentrations, **claims of bias cannot be substantiated without population normalization.** These insights are currently observational.
    *   The **increasing delay in crime reporting** is a major concern and warrants significant further investigation, potentially indicating issues with public trust or reporting processes.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

*   **Main Conclusion:** Despite LAPD having strategic plans (e.g., the mentioned 2021-2023 plan), the analyzed data clearly shows that **crime rates in Los Angeles increased** between 2020 and 2024. This trend, coupled with a reported decrease in LA's population during this period, suggests that current strategies may not be sufficient or effective in curbing the rise in crime. The increasing delay in reporting further complicates the picture.
*   **Actionable Recommendations for LAPD/Policymakers:**
    *   **Targeted Deployment:** Use the specific temporal (Afternoon, Friday, October) and spatial (Central area) insights to tailor patrol strategies and resource allocation.
    *   **Focus on Hot Crimes:** Develop specific interventions targeting 'Motor Vehicle Theft' and 'Burglary from Vehicle', especially in identified hotspots.
    *   **Investigate Reporting Delays:** Urgently investigate the root causes behind the increasing time lag in crime reporting. This could involve surveys, process reviews, and community outreach to understand if it relates to public trust, accessibility, or other barriers.
    *   **Contextualize Demographics:** Seek additional data (e.g., census population data) to properly contextualize victim demographic distributions and investigate potential disparities or biases based on race or age.
    *   **Technology Integration:** Continue integrating advanced technology (as per their strategic plan) but evaluate its effectiveness based on actual crime trends and reporting metrics.
